-- NOTES
-- 1. Use data from OpenFDA (fda_food.food_enforcement) from BigQuery public data (but also available in JSON format here: https://open.fda.gov/data/downloads/)
-- 2. Complete database has 27,138 records from 2012 to the present (updated March 2025).
-- 3. The field "state" is the location of recalling firm and "distribution_pattern" is the state(s) included in initial distribution, or note that it's a nationwide recall. What story do these tell about Vermont?


-- FINAL QUERY - Combines various queries below which are left in to show though process and important results.
-- Need to join the two tables created above--one that shows VT product recalls, and the other that shows firms.
-- Use pr and fr as aliases.
